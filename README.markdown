## world-currencies

We needed a list of as many world currencies as we could find. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a program consumable collection of names to symbols to ISO codes out there, so this repository is the fruit of finding those.

So, this repository contains collections of world currencies in programmatically consuming friendly way. It contains currency names, symbols, and ISO-4217 code.

It is based on the currency collection table from the University of British Columbia, Sauder School of Business. http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/currency_table.html

For any pieces of information we have tried to scan and input those from wikipedia.
